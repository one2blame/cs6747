# Module 1

There's really not much to these lessons, so I've only taken notes by exception.
This lesson provides an introduction to the x86 instruction set, and displays
the differences between AT&T and Intel x86 syntax. This lesson also covers
the `cdecl` calling convention and how the stack is used for function calls.
Finally, this lesson covers the registers for x86 and amd64, going over what
each register is used for and how they are treated under different
circumstances.
